Classifying waveforms using kNN mehtod
  In this project, we aim to classify three different classes of
waves using the kNN algorithm. In our experiments, our goals
are: (1) finding the best k in the algorithm, which has the
closest accuracy to the optimal Bayes classification rate. (2)
Analyzing the bias-variance trade-off, comparing true and
empirical risks over different values of k. (3) applying data
reduction techniques to reduce the complexity of kNN. (4)
generating an artificial imbalance in our data to examine its
effects on the performance of kNN.
